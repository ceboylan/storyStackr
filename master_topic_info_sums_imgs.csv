But even with all the scientific explanations offered to her by the undeniably clueless doctors she's been living on lies. Because as it turns out her disease isn't even a disease at all but an unfortunate side-effect of swapping souls with her childhood friend Sarah. Now after swapping back into her true body Melissa discovers that getting to this point was only half the battle. Her powers are suddenly uncontrollable she's haunted by fragmented memories of her past at night and plagued by unanswerable questions during the day. On top of all that she's due to enrol in a new school in only a matter of days. Never mind the fact that no one can get her name right if she doesn't learn how to control her powers before school starts she'll be the talk of the town. But there are deadlier battles on the horizon. Suddenly the half-century old prophecy that paints her as the saviour has come back to bite her in the butt and if she can't figure out how to stop her uncle before his new project turns into a reality they may very well end up on course for an apocalypse. All Melissa has ever wanted was a chance at life - a normal life - but now it looks as though she won't survive the winter. And when someone she loves comes back from the dead she realises that the answers she seeks are buried much deeper then she could ever have imagined and in order to find out the truth about her future she'll have to go back a hundred years in the past. 2015 by shayebay This novel is entirely a work of fiction.

But even with all the scientific explanations offered to her by the undeniably clueless doctors she's been living on lies. Because as it turns out her disease isn't even a disease at all but an unfortunate side-effect of swapping souls with her childhood friend Sarah. Now after swapping back into her true body Melissa discovers that getting to this point was only half the battle. Her powers are suddenly uncontrollable she's haunted by fragmented memories of her past at night and plagued by unanswerable questions during the day. On top of all that she's due to enrol in a new school in only a matter of days. Never mind the fact that no one can get her name right if she doesn't learn how to control her powers before school starts she'll be the talk of the town. But there are deadlier battles on the horizon. Suddenly the half-century old prophecy that paints her as the saviour has come back to bite her in the butt and if she can't figure out how to stop her uncle before his new project turns into a reality they may very well end up on course for an apocalypse. All Melissa has ever wanted was a chance at life - a normal life - but now it looks as though she won't survive the winter. And when someone she loves comes back from the dead she realises that the answers she seeks are buried much deeper then she could ever have imagined and in order to find out the truth about her future she'll have to go back a hundred years in the past. 2015 by shayebay This novel is entirely a work of fiction.

But Evelin Jiyu a young girl in the war-torn village of Muoro is a thief of the greatest prize of all: free will. The Makers are the gods worshipped by the villagers and anyone who denies their teachings is executed. From a young age all villagers join a caste based on the amount of free will the Makers have given them and this caste will lead to a career that is their one true path in life. But even the most carefully orchestrated heist can be unraveled by one mistake - and the Makers' biggest mistake is Evelin. A glitch in the system Evelin got away with free will; she has never really fit into a caste and has never been so smitten with the Makers. To admit this would be to place her own head on a chopping block. Instead she hides in the lowest caste of all and keeps her free will a secret. At her graduation ceremony her lies will be revealed. Only a graduate from the highest caste will be chosen to lead a war against the neighboring village Faero. But when fate chooses her as the Seeker the questions begin and Evelin fears for her life. Abandoning her home and family in the midst of a war to save her own head Evelin flees from the Makers' retribution. She runs to the one place where the Makers cannot reach her and where all of their secrets might be revealed: the Edge of the world. *The Edge of the World is a Wattpad Featured Story *The amazing cover was made by @Ferret-bird,https://www.wattpad.com/story/19081483-the-edge-of-the-world,topic40.png78,Paranormal,other,10.40%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other.png79,Poetry,Topic 1,42.80%,sad,poetri,depress,poem,love,hurt,heartbreak,hope,happi,loss,"sad, poetri, depress, poem, love, hurt, heartbreak, hope, happi, loss",You are the reason I have ink stains on my fingertips.

But even the most carefully orchestrated heist can be unraveled by one mistake - and the Makers' biggest mistake is Evelin. A glitch in the system Evelin got away with free will; she has never really fit into a caste and has never been so smitten with the Makers. To admit this would be to place her own head on a chopping block. Instead she hides in the lowest caste of all and keeps her free will a secret. At her graduation ceremony her lies will be revealed. Only a graduate from the highest caste will be chosen to lead a war against the neighboring village Faero. But when fate chooses her as the Seeker the questions begin and Evelin fears for her life. Abandoning her home and family in the midst of a war to save her own head Evelin flees from the Makers' retribution. She runs to the one place where the Makers cannot reach her and where all of their secrets might be revealed: the Edge of the world. *The Edge of the World is a Wattpad Featured Story *The amazing cover was made by @Ferret-bird,https://www.wattpad.com/story/19081483-the-edge-of-the-world,topic40.png120,Vampire,other,22.80%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,other.png121,Werewolf,Topic 38,54.10%,werewolf,mate,alpha,love,romanc,reject,wolf,pack,luna,watti,"werewolf, mate, alpha, love, romanc, reject, wolf, pack, luna, watti","""What's your name.""

There's a darkness that lurks in the City of Light Seventeen-year-old Connor Lewis is chased by a memory. On his first day of kindergarten he bit a boy hard enough to scar the kid for life. Since then he's been a social outcast at a New York private school. Through an unexpected turn of good fortune he lands a scholarship to study in Paris where everything starts to look up. On the first day he befriends two military brats and he may finally get a taste of what it's like to be a normal teenager. It doesn't last. His host family - an alluring young tattoo artist and her moody handsome boyfriend - inadvertently introduce him to the underworld of werewolves where there are two types: the born and the bitten. Those born to it take the form of elegant wolves while the latter are cursed to transform into the half-man half-beast creatures of horror movies. The bitten rarely survive. Unfortunately Connor is on the wanted list of a four hundred-year-old bitten human who is searching for both a cure and a means of wiping out werewolves for good. Connor's loyalties are tested as he becomes embroiled in a conflict where werewolves mad science and teen angst collide. POSTING ON TUESDAYS & THURSDAYS!

But even with all the scientific explanations offered to her by the undeniably clueless doctors she's been living on lies. Because as it turns out her disease isn't even a disease at all but an unfortunate side-effect of swapping souls with her childhood friend Sarah. Now after swapping back into her true body Melissa discovers that getting to this point was only half the battle. Her powers are suddenly uncontrollable she's haunted by fragmented memories of her past at night and plagued by unanswerable questions during the day. On top of all that she's due to enrol in a new school in only a matter of days. Never mind the fact that no one can get her name right if she doesn't learn how to control her powers before school starts she'll be the talk of the town. But there are deadlier battles on the horizon. Suddenly the half-century old prophecy that paints her as the saviour has come back to bite her in the butt and if she can't figure out how to stop her uncle before his new project turns into a reality they may very well end up on course for an apocalypse. All Melissa has ever wanted was a chance at life - a normal life - but now it looks as though she won't survive the winter. And when someone she loves comes back from the dead she realises that the answers she seeks are buried much deeper then she could ever have imagined and in order to find out the truth about her future she'll have to go back a hundred years in the past. 2015 by shayebay This novel is entirely a work of fiction.
